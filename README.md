# Drum-Kit

Creating a simple web-based drum kit that allows users to play various drum sounds by either clicking on the buttons or using keyboard keys.


Features:

Clickable Buttons: Seven buttons representing different drum sounds are displayed on the web page. Users can click on these buttons to trigger the corresponding drum sound.

Keyboard Interaction: Users can also trigger drum sounds by pressing specific keys on their keyboard. Each button corresponds to a specific keyboard key, allowing users to play the drum sounds using their keyboard.

Button Animation: When a button is clicked or a corresponding key is pressed, a brief animation effect is applied to the button to provide visual feedback to the user.


HTML Structure:

The HTML file (index.html) includes elements for the title, drum buttons, and JavaScript file import.


JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript file (index.js) contains functionality to handle button clicks and keyboard interactions.

Event listeners are used to detect button clicks and keypress events.

A switch statement determines which drum sound to play based on the button clicked or key pressed.

Each drum sound is played using the HTML5 Audio API.


CSS Styling:

The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling for the drum buttons, title, and footer.
Button styling includes background images representing different drum types and animation effects for button clicks.
